I am a Professor of Financial Econometrics at [Brandeis School of Business and Economics](https://www.brandeis.edu/global/). My research focuses on time-series econometrics, Bayesian methods, asset allocation, and portfolio optimization, with applications to forecasting, financial markets, and macroeconomic dynamics. 

My work has been published in leading journals including the Journal of Finance, the Journal of Financial Economics, Management Science, Review of Economic Studies, and the Journal of Econometrics.

At Brandeis, I teach econometrics across undergraduate, master’s, and PhD programs, where I emphasize empirical applications and computational implementations. I also serve as an Associate Editor for the Journal of Financial Econometrics.

Prior to joining Brandeis, I worked in the antitrust practice of the litigation consuting firm [Bates White LLC](http://bateswhite.com/) in SanDiego, CA. I earned my Ph.D. in Economics from Bocconi University.
